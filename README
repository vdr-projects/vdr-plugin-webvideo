Webvi is a tool for downloading and playing videos from popular video
sharing websites such as YouTube. There are two interfaces: a plugin
for Video Disk Recorder (VDR), and a command line client. The two
interfaces are described in README.vdrplugin and README.webvi.

The common functionality of the VDR plugin and the command line client
is implemented in a Python library (src/libwebvi/webvi). C bindings
for the library are also provided (see src/libwebvi/libwebvi.h).

Supported video sites:

* Google Video [1]
* Metacafe
* MTV3 Katsomo [2]
* ruutu.fi [3]
* YLE Areena [4]
* YouTube

[1] Only videos hosted by Google, YouTube, Metacafe

[2] Experimental, requires curl and avconv

[3] Requires rtmpdump: http://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu/

[4] Requires yle-dl: http://aajanki.github.com/yle-dl/

Because of the modular design it is possible to add support for new
sites quite easily. See doc/developers.txt for more information.
